# Why this list?

The software eco-system for macOS over the last decade has been in a huge growing state. There's a lot of new software and apps which offers high quality, native and polished experience, or just enhancing the existing macOS experience to suit personal needs.

Due to the growth like many other store fronts, sooner or later it gets hard to browse for hidden gems and new upcoming software. I made this list as a personal goto when others ask me for good software recommendations. This site has no commercial side other other than pointing users to support the developers, trough the Mac App Store when available.

## Help me improve the list

This list is by no mean perfect. If you want to add a software to the list or change things up, please give me feedback trough the links in the top right coner or suggest a change on the specific category page.


## The curation of software

### Software that mess with security

I do not include any software that require lowering the security or disable SIP ("rootless"). We want to improve the experience of MacOS without any kind of "hacks" and so on. Therefore applications like MacForge or cDock etc. is rejected.

### Paid Software

In the Apple eco-system, there's a lot higher degree of paid/subscription software with a higher expectency to support developers who's made a great well-crafted app that instead of using example a "free web app" that's just a webpage wrapper. Example of a paid application would be Sketch, while a free web app like Figma would be rejected.

### Free and Open-Source Software

If an app is FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) but also feature the same quality as a premium Mac app, that will be on the list. Apps of this kind is VLC or Transmission, in contrast to GIMP or Audacity that even tho it does the job, the UI/UX polish, OS integration etc. is not on the same level and therefore rejected. Same reason why a closed-source software like Screenflow and Wirecast is on the list, but not OBS.

### Oudated & Legacy software 

Software that hasn't been updated but also isn't relevant anymore is rejected. Examples would be apps like Growl or Hyperdock while others that even tho hasn't been updated in years can be still relevant and useful today.

### Frameworks

As for UI, libraries, frameworks etc, the more native look and feel of a software where it looks like a part of the OS it self is what's promoted. Example of what's preferred is Cocoa, Qt, AppKit, SwiftUI (Catalyst) etc. while rejecting most CEF, Electron, JavaFX, Swing etc.

Most web applications wrappers does not comply with the UI guidelines, drains the battery and increase both your internet bandwidth and RAM usage, reimplement existing OS features while many times lacking native OS features, therefore is rejected.

### Privacy Policies

In this day and age it's hard to stay away from software that in one or another way collect personal data on you as it's not always told, or discovered until much later due to the nature of closed-source software. But as a general guideline apps that's been known to be privacy infringing, do inferious data collecting etc. will mostly be rejected.

### No company-specific software

For any software that's specific to a single platform or company is rejected. Things of that kind would be Github Desktop or Tunnelbear VPN, while a app like Sourcetree made by Atlassian would be on the list.
